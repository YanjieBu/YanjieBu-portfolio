                          The design concept of this Brisbane wildlife app integrates 
                          learning, science popularization, entertainment, social interaction, 
                          and courses into a multifunctional platform. Users can not only 
                          access comprehensive information about Australian wildlife but 
                          also gain deeper insights into and protection of these species 
                          through interactive experiences and practical activities. 
                          The highlight of the app is to combine outdoor activities with 
                          wildlife knowledge, rewarding users by completing outdoor 
                          challenges to increase engagement and experience.

                        In our team, Nature Navigator, which consists of five members, 
                        my primary responsibility was in the design area. I took part 
                        in the preliminary research phase, gathering and analyzing user 
                        needs, and subsequently developed detailed user personas to 
                        guide our design process. I independently designed the app 
                        icon and the team logo and created the web interface prototypes 
                        to ensure a clear and intuitive user experience. Additionally, 
                        I contributed to the development of the homepage and Wiki page, 
                        establishing a solid foundation for the project's overall visual 
                        identity and user experience. Through my design efforts, our team's 
                        project achieved enhanced visual appeal and usability.

                  <p>
                    In Week4 & Week5, our team, Nature Navigator, finalized the 
                    project theme, focusing on animal conservation, particularly 
                    displaying wildlife information for Australia or Brisbane area. 
                    As the lead designer, I sketched the initial interface on a 
                    whiteboard and collaborated with teammates to discuss the website's 
                    functionality and layout, incorporating elements from my previous 
                    poster design. Together, we established the basic project framework 
                    and gathered relevant datasets, including information on koala 
                    populations, storm tide data, and other local wildlife data. We 
                    also engaged in cross-group discussions, sharing our project 
                    concept and receiving feedback from other groups. This process 
                    helped us identify design flaws and inspired new ideas.

                  <p>
                    During Weeks 5&6&7, I designed our team logo (see left image), 
                    featuring a friendly koala as the main visual element. The koala 
                    is set against green foliage, symbolizing the natural environment 
                    and conveying a sense of warmth and approachability. This design 
                    highlights our commitment to wildlife conservation and resonates 
                    with our focus on Australia’s native animals. The simplicity of 
                    the logo makes it versatile, allowing it to be effectively used 
                    on our website and promotional materials while clearly reflecting 
                    our team's values.

                  <p>
                    Additionally, I designed the app icon (see right image), combining 
                    a compass and a kangaroo to symbolize exploration and guidance. The 
                    compass represents our mission to help users navigate the world of 
                    wildlife conservation, while the kangaroo signifies the unique wildlife 
                    of Australia. Surrounding the compass are animal footprints, reinforcing 
                    the theme of ecological preservation and our dedication to leaving 
                    a positive mark on the environment. This app icon is easily recognizable 
                    and aligns with the broader theme of our project.

                    In the following stages, I conducted a comprehensive user research 
                    process, combining offline surveys with online interviews. Leveraging 
                    AI tools, I facilitated user interviews to gather detailed insights. 
                    This research allowed me to accurately capture the needs, motivations, 
                    and pain points of potential users. Based on these findings, I created 
                    three user personas, each representing a distinct type of user for 
                    our app: the nature lover, the animal protector, and the outdoor 
                    enthusiast. These personas helped to clarify the website's target 
                    audience and guided the design decisions to align with users' 
                    specific expectations and requirements.

                    Building on the initial hand-drawn prototypes created both in 
                    and outside of class, I developed a comprehensive series of web 
                    prototypes using Figma. These sketches served as the foundation, 
                    allowing me to translate the rough concepts into a more refined and 
                    interactive digital design. Through Figma, I was able to enhance 
                    the flow, add detailed UI elements, and visually represent the 
                    website's intended user experience. This approach helped to clarify 
                    the functionality and interactions within the platform, ensuring each 
                    component aligns with the needs identified during user research.

                    I developed a series of web prototypes using Figma to refine our app's 
                    interface and functionality. The design flow includes multiple pages: 
                    an introduction screen, login page, homepage with a map interface, 
                    personal profile, and an activity page. Each page integrates elements 
                    essential for user engagement, such as a map to track wildlife locations, 
                    challenges to encourage exploration, and an activity review for 
                    social interaction.

                      types. A search bar is available for users to filter animals or 
                      locations by name, enhancing accessibility. The personal profile 
                      page provides users with a space to track their activities, connect 
                      with friends, and view completed challenges. Additionally, the 
                      activity page showcases wildlife-related events, rewards, and a 
                      product section, all designed to support an immersive wildlife 
                      exploration experience.

                      The search functionality within the prototype is designed to allow 
                      users to explore wildlife in specific locations with ease. Starting 
                      from the main search results page, users can view multiple animal 
                      icons spread across a map, each icon representing wildlife spotted 
                      in different areas. Users can zoom into a selected region to find 
                      more detailed results on the “Search Result Zoom” page. Here, they 
                      gain insights into specific locations, including user posts and 
                      sightings. Finally, the "Animal Information" page provides 
                      comprehensive details on the chosen animal, including habitat, 
                      behavior, and legal protection information. This page integrates 
                      user-generated posts, offering a community-driven perspective and 
                      allowing users to share experiences and sightings, enhancing engagement

                  <h3>Week7 & Week8</h3>
                  <p>
                    During our group project on animal conservation, we created a 
                    paper prototype to visualize the design and functionality of our 
                    web interface. Our goal was to craft a user-friendly platform 
                    highlighting wildlife conservation activities around Brisbane. 
                    I was responsible for sketching on the whiteboard and took part in 
                    role-based testing sessions. Our prototype covered the welcome page, 
                    navigation bar, profile settings, social features, and interactive 
                    content displays. This process revealed important design 
                    insights—specifically, we identified that certain interaction buttons 
                    were overly complex, and the activity page was too information-dense, 
                    causing potential user confusion. Based on these observations, we 
                    refined our design to prioritize simplicity and clarity, ensuring a 
                    more intuitive user experience. This experience underscored the value

                  <h3>Week9 & Week10</h3>
                  <p>
                    During the development phase of our website, our team began 
                    programming the web pages, and I contributed to the HTML and CSS 
                    coding for both the homepage and the wiki page. This hands-on 
                    experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of front-end 
                    development and apply design principles to ensure a cohesive and 
                    visually appealing interface. Additionally, I took the opportunity 
                    to learn from my teammates, acquiring valuable insights and skills 
                    in JavaScript and PHP programming. This cross-functional learning 
                    broadened my technical skill set and enabled me to contribute more 
                    effectively to our collaborative project.
                  </p>
                  <img src="images/image15.png" alt="Project Thumbnail" class="image15">
                  <p>
                    Currently, I am working on the layout design for the homepage and 
                    wiki page of our project to ensure they are functional and visually 
                    organized. The homepage features an interactive map with markers 
                    representing various wildlife locations around Brisbane, allowing 
                    users to search for specific animals and explore their habitats. 
                    The wiki page displays a series of cards with images, scientific 
                    names, and conservation statuses for different species, providing 
                    users with a quick overview and a search bar for easy navigation. 
                    As we continue developing more features, I plan to refine these 
                    layouts further, focusing on both aesthetics and usability to make 
                    the interface more engaging and intuitive for users.

                      Moving forward, I will be refining the prototypes to create 
                      high-fidelity versions that will be implemented in VSCode and 
                      integrated into the website. By enhancing the design's detail 
                      and realism, I aim to provide a clear vision for the final interface. 
                      Additionally, with the Java and PHP skills I've been acquiring, 
                      I'm now equipped to contribute more directly to the project's 
                      functionality. This knowledge will allow me to add and modify 
                      features independently, enhancing the interactivity and user 
                      experience of our web application.

                  <h2>Project Planning and Team Collaboration</h2>
                  <p>
                    At the beginning, our diverse team struggled to align our different 
                    perspectives, given our varied backgrounds. Establishing clear roles, 
                    regular communication, and setting a shared vision became essential 
                    to keep us on track. Research emphasizes that inclusivity and regular 
                    communication improve cohesion in diverse teams (Meyer et al., 2014). 
                    This experience taught me how crucial it is to foster cohesion and 
                    align everyone with the project goals, a skill that is essential for 
                    future collaborations (Dyer et al., 2013).

                    <p>
                      Developing the prototype exposed usability issues, such as overly 
                      complex buttons and excessive information on certain pages. User 
                      feedback was invaluable for simplifying the design, aligning with 
                      iterative design models where improvements come through repetitive 
                      testing and refinement (Nielsen & Molich, 1990). This process 
                      underscored the importance of clarity in user interactions and 
                      highlighted how iterative feedback is key to creating a user-friendly product.

                          <p>
                            After consulting with our tutor, our team decided to focus on core 
                            features and streamline the project scope. Initially, we aimed to 
                            include a wide range of functionalities, but this ambition led to 
                            technical challenges and time constraints, stressing the team and 
                            impacting progress. This experience highlighted the need to balance 
                            ambition with practicality, as Brooks (1995) notes in The Mythical 
                            Man-Month. By narrowing our scope, we were able to focus on delivering 
                            key features that best served user needs, reinforcing the importance 
                            of prioritizing quality over quantity to achieve a successful outcome.

                    <p>
                      One of the biggest lessons I learned was the importance of rehearsing 
                      and managing time during presentations. We ran out of time while 
                      presenting and had to rush through some sections, which affected 
                      the impact of our work. This feedback underscored the importance of 
                      practice and pacing to ensure that every team member can effectively 
                      communicate their part. I now understand that a well-paced presentation 
                      is just as crucial as the content itself.

                  <div class="text10">
                    <p>
                      Integrating external datasets turned out to be more challenging than 
                      anticipated, as we struggled to find compatible data sources. This 
                      experience taught me the importance of early research and preparation, 
                      especially when relying on external data. I also became more comfortable 
                      with API integration and better understood how to manage the technical 
                      requirements for future projects. This learning process helped me develop 
                      resilience in troubleshooting and adapting when technical roadblocks arise.

                      I took every opportunity to expand my skills in web development, 
                      including JavaScript and PHP, by working closely with my teammates. 
                      I also gained insights into user-centered design, which has deepened 
                      my understanding of how to create effective, intuitive interfaces. 
                      Through this process, I learned to approach challenges as learning 
                      experiences and grew more confident in my technical and design abilities.

                    <p>
                      Writing weekly journals helped me cultivate a habit of 
                      self-assessment and allowed me to keep track of my progress, 
                      challenges, and learnings throughout the project. Each journal 
                      entry prompted me to evaluate what went well, what could have 
                      been improved, and how I could approach similar challenges in 
                      the future. This journaling process allowed me to recognize my 
                      strengths and weaknesses and adapt my approach accordingly. It 
                      reinforced the importance of continuous learning, personal growth, 
                      and adaptation. I came to understand that journaling is a critical 
                      part of professional development, as it enables me to make informed 
                      adjustments to my work and grow as a designer and collaborator.
